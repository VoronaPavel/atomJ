# AtomJ
After using IntelliJ and it's keybindings for years it is hard to switch to an editor with a new set of keybindings.

**Meet**: [IntelliJ keybindings](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/docs/IntelliJIDEA_ReferenceCard_Mac.pdf) combined with [Pivotal's additions](https://github.com/Pivotal-Boulder/IDE-Preferences) for the [Atom](https://atom.io/) editor.

# Usage

```
git clone git@github.com:geapi/atomJ.git
cd atomJ
ln -s keymap.cson ~/.atom/keymap.cson
```
